# DESIGN PATTERNS

---

This project aims to educate junior developers in one fairly useful portion of application design, i.e. **design patterns**.
It describes a context of fictional software [prototype](#prototype), within which individual patterns are explained.
All examples then stand completely independent of the others, but still reflect concrete parts of the prototype.
