# DESIGN PATTERNS

This project aims to educate junior developers in one fairly useful portion of application design, i.e. **design patterns**.
It describes a context of fictional software [prototype](#prototype) within which individual patterns are explained.
All examples then stand completely independent of each other but still reflect particular parts of the prototype.

# PROTOTYPE

[TODO] generic description of what, why and how

### ARCHITECTURE

[TODO] high-level description of individual components

### THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS 

These platforms are merely meant to be used as examples and can be swapped out for others that provide the same functions.

- **OpenShift** Container Platform is RedHat's on-premise cloud for hosting application, built around Linux containers orchestrated by Kubernetes.
